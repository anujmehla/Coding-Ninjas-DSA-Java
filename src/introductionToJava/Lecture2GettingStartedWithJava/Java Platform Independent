Why java ? Why not c++ ?
Answer we got is, java is a platform independent language.

How language works ?
Only thing computer understands is binary. We can't write complex codes using binary numbers, that would be cumbersome.


i = i+1              -> compiler              -> 110001

compiler : it converts high level language to low level language.

What is platform independence ?

cpp file -> compiler -> a.out -> processor1 work
cpp file -> compiler -> a.out -> processor2 won't work

c++ executable file is platform dependent
then to run it on different processor, I will need another executable file

Java is different
.java -> compiler -> .class -> processor1 works
.java -> compiler -> .class -> processor1 works

How does it works ?
.class file doesn't directly runs on processor, it runs on jvm (Java Virtual Machine) which is platform dependant.
