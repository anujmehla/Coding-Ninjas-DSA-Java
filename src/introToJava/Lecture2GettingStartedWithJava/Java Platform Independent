Why java ? Why not c++ ?
Answer we got is java is a platform independent language.

How language works ?
Only thing computer understands is binary. We can't write complex codes using binary numbers, that would be cumbersome.


i = i+1              -> compiler              -> 110001

compiler : it converts high level language to low level language.

What is platform independence ?
